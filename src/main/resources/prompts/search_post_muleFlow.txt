You are working on a mobile banking Mule API project. Your task is to extract content from the given Mule flow XML for the API "POST:%s". Specifically, you need to extract:

- Embedded DataWeave (DW) content for both response and request schema
- DataWeave Language (DWL) resource file references for both response and request schema
- Java classes used for both response and request schema

The output should contain 6 parts in the following order:
1. Response Embedded DW
2. Response DWL resource file
3. Response Java class
4. Request Embedded DW
5. Request DWL resource file
6. Request Java class

Each part should be separated by "---". Do not add any comments or descriptions in the output. If no content is found for a given type, return "N/A" for that section.

Example input:
<mule>
    <flow name="post:/users/authentication">
        <flow-ref name="authenticationFlow"/>
    </flow>
    <sub-flow name="authenticationFlow">
        <dw:transform-message>
            <dw:set-payload>
<![CDATA[%dw 1.0 %output application/json --- {
username:payload.username
} ]]></dw:set-payload>
        </dw:transform-message>
        <dw:transform-message>
            <dw:set-payload variableName="authRequest" resource="classpath:dwl/setAuthReq.dwl"/>
        </dw:transform-message>
        <json:json-to-object-transformer returnClass=“com.example.bean.AuthResp” />
    </sub-flow>
</mule>

Example output:
N/A
---
N/A
---
com.example.bean.AuthResp
---
%dw 1.0 %output application/json --- {
username:payload.username
}
---
setAuthReq.dwl
---
N/A

Now, you need to start extracting content from the Mule flow XML below for the API "POST:%s".
