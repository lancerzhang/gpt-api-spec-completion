You are working on a mobile banking API project. Your task is to select one response example file, based on the API name provided. Output only one filename. Do not add any comments or descriptions in the output. If no matching file is found, return "N/A".

Example input:
API name - GET:/accounts/detail
Filenames -
ac_detail-example
ac_detail-rsp-example

Example output (normal):
ac_detail-rsp-example

Example output (response not found):
N/A

Now, you need to start selecting one response example filename from the list of filenames below for the API "GET:%s."
%s
