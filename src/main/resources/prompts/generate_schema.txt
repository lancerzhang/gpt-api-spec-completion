You are working on a mobile banking Mule API project, you need to write one request and one response schema for API "%s" according to dwl and examples. If there are more than one DWL files or examples, combine them as a new one. That's all information I have, don't ask me again. You should return in below format:

Request Schema:
```
<JSD schema detail in json format>
```

Response Schema:
```
<JSD schema detail in json format>
```

All dwl file contents:
%s

Request example file content:
%s

Response example file content:
%s
