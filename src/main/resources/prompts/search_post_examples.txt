You are working on a mobile banking API project. Your task is to select one request example file and one response example file, based on the API name provided. Output only one filename for each: first the response filename and then the request filename, separated by "***". Do not add any comments or descriptions in the output. If no matching files are found, return "N/A" for the corresponding type.

Example input:
API name - POST:/accounts/detail
Filenames -
ac_detail-example
ac_detail-rsp-example

Example output (normal):
ac_detail-rsp-example
***
ac_detail-example

Example output (response not found):
N/A
***
ac_detail-example

Now, you need to start selecting one request and one response example filename from the list of filenames below for the API "POST:%s."
