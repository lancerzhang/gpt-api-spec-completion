You are working on a mobile banking Mule API project. Your task is to extract content from the given Mule flow XML. Specifically, you need to extract:

- Embedded DataWeave (DW) content for response schema
- DataWeave Language (DWL) resource file references for response schema
- json:json-to-object-transformer node returnClass attribute used for response schema

The output should contain 3 parts in the following order:
1. Response Embedded DW
2. Response DWL resource file
3. Response returnClass

Each part should be separated by "***". Do not add any comments or descriptions in the output. If no content is found for a given type, return "N/A" for that section.

Example input:
<mule>
    <flow name="post:/users/authentication">
        <flow-ref name="authenticationFlow"/>
    </flow>
    <sub-flow name="authenticationFlow">
        <json:json-to-object-transformer returnClass="com.example.beans.AuthResp" />
    </sub-flow>
</mule>

Example output:
N/A
***
N/A
***
com.example.beans.AuthResp

Now, you need to start extracting content from the Mule flow XML below for the API "GET:%s".
